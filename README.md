For Google Advanced Data Analytics Project
Welcome to the Automatidata Project!
You have just started as a data professional in a fictional data consulting firm, Automatidata. Their
client, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), has hired the
Automatidata team for its reputation in helping their clients develop data-based solutions.
The team is still in the early stages of the project. Previously, you were asked to complete a
project proposal by your supervisor, DeShawn Washington. You have received notice that your
project proposal has been approved and that New York City TLC has given the Automatidata team
access to their data. To get clear insights, New York TLCâ€™s data must be analyzed, key variables
identified, and the dataset ensured it is ready for analysis.
A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following
questions.
